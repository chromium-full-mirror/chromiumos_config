"""Constraint checks related to program and project ids.

A note on how some of the checks relate:

- check_design_config_id_segments: Checks that a project's ids fall within the
segment specified in the program config.
- check_design_config_id_segments_overlap: Checks that no id segments overlap.
- check_design_config_ids_unique: Checks that ids within a project are unique.

Together, these constraints enforce uniqueness across a program. If two ids
within a project are the same, this is rejected by
check_design_config_ids_unique. If two ids in different projects are the same,
at least one of them must be out of the specified segment, because no two
segments can overlap.
